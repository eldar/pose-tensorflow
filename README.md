# Pose Estimation with TensorFlow (PoseTF)

## Preamble

This is a fork of [@eldar's pose-tensorflow](https://github.com/eldar/pose-tensorflow) repository for tracking multiple body parts in images using the Human Body Pose Estimation algorithm. It also works great for animal pose (demonstrated in [Mathis et al, 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y)).

The purpose of this fork is to make the interface to the algorithm more modular and easier to integrate into a standard Python workflow.

Here is an example Python script that shows how the new modular organization works.


    # The entire module can now be imported
    import PoseTF
    
    # Train a network, specifying the configuration file to use,
    # the amount of GPU memory to request, the GPU to use, and
    # the number of snapshots to keep on disk.
    PoseTF.training.train(
        cfg_filename='pose_cfg.yaml', 
        max_to_keep=None, # Keep all snapshots!
        memfrac=.3,
        disable_autotune=True,
        choose_gpu=3,
    )


The script and the dataset and can be located in any directory. It no longer has to be located in the "models" subdirectory in this repository.

The old syntax `python3 ../../../train.py` still works, but is no longer necessary.

Original documentation is located below.

presented in the [ArtTrack](http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01465) and [DeeperCut](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03170) papers:

Python 3 is required to run this code.
First of all, you should install TensorFlow as described in the
[official documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
We recommended to use `virtualenv`.

You will also need to install the following Python packages:

```
$ pip3 install scipy scikit-image matplotlib pyyaml easydict cython munkres
```

When running training or prediction scripts, please make sure to set the environment variable
`TF_CUDNN_USE_AUTOTUNE` to 0 (see [this ticket](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/5048)
for explanation).

If your machine has multiple GPUs, you can select which GPU you want to run on
by setting the environment variable, eg. `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`.

## Demo code

Single-Person (if there is only one person in the image)

```
# Download pre-trained model files
$ cd models/mpii
$ ./download_models.sh
$ cd -

# Run demo of single person pose estimation
$ TF_CUDNN_USE_AUTOTUNE=0 python3 demo/singleperson.py
```

Multiple People

```
# Compile dependencies
$ ./compile.sh

# Download pre-trained model files
$ cd models/coco
$ ./download_models.sh
$ cd -

# Run demo of multi person pose estimation
$ TF_CUDNN_USE_AUTOTUNE=0 python3 demo/demo_multiperson.py
```

## Training models

Please follow these [instructions](models/README.md)
