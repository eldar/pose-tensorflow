# Human Pose Estimation with TensorFlow

![](images/teaser.png)

Here you can find the implementation of the Human Body Pose Estimation algorithm,
presented in the [ArtTrack](http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01465) and [DeeperCut](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03170) papers:

Python 3 is required to run this code.
On Linux, you may need to install the `python3-dev` and `python3-tk` packages.

We recommended using `virtualenv` to create an isolated Python environment.

You will also need to install the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`,
including TensorFlow:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When running training or prediction scripts, please make sure to set the environment variable
`TF_CUDNN_USE_AUTOTUNE` to 0 (see [this ticket](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/5048)
for explanation).

If your machine has multiple GPUs, you can select which GPU you want to run on
by setting the environment variable, eg. `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`.

## Demo code

Single-Person (if there is only one person in the image)

```
# Download pre-trained model files
$ cd models/mpii
$ ./download_models.sh
$ cd -

# Run demo of single person pose estimation
$ TF_CUDNN_USE_AUTOTUNE=0 python3 demo/singleperson.py
```

Multiple People

```
# Compile dependencies
$ ./compile.sh

# Download pre-trained model files
$ cd models/coco
$ ./download_models.sh
$ cd -

# Run demo of multi person pose estimation
$ TF_CUDNN_USE_AUTOTUNE=0 python3 demo/demo_multiperson.py
```

## Training models

Please follow these [instructions](models/README.md)
